**FALKOR**

Yes, this is named after the Luck Dragon from The Never Ending Story, because this repo needed not just a name, but a mascot.
And a kindly flying dog seemed appropriate. Soon after this repo was created, by kismet, I ran into Falkor in AltSpaceVR.

##Falkor is many things. 
First, it's a Wordpress theme.
It also has a node-gulp-sass for bundling SCSS and JS
It uses the Wordpress Rest API and renders static json packets
These are all quaint and useful in a 2D content World

But now we're in the webXR world. and it's time to build for it.
So this repo will be integrating the best of WebXR into it for immersive experiences on supporting browsers.

If you have Oculus Quest or a device with the Mozilla Reality Browser, you'll need that to full take advantage of immersive WebXR. 

A work in progress.
